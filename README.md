# Java_Projects
Greetings everyone, I am pleased to present my Java project which comprises of two exciting applications created using the Java programming language. The first application is a stock management system that is designed to help businesses efficiently manage their stock inventory. The second application is a quiz application that is intended to engage users in a fun and interactive way while testing their knowledge on various topics. The applications were developed using Java, a programming language known for its versatility, reliability, and robustness. With the help of Java, I was able to create these applications with ease and efficiency, providing a seamless user experience.
